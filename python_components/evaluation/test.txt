## Background

### Project Origins
The Sugar House Safe Side Streets Study originated from a Constituent Capital Improvement Program request for funding to implement neighborhood traffic calming in a portion of Sugar House north of 2100 South. Recommendations developed for this study relied on traffic data, community input and a constrained budget to address key concerns throughout the study area.

### Study Area
**Sugarhouse Neighborhood**

The study area consists of the residential neighborhood bounded by 2100 South, 1100 East, 900 East, and Garfield Avenue in Sugar House. Despite the area's residential nature and existing traffic calming, concerns about unsafe driving are common.

**Key Features:**
- 10 City Blocks
- 3 Businesses
- In the heart of Sugar House
- Home to single family, multifamily, and senior residential

**Existing Traffic Calming Measures:**
- Traffic Circle
- Splitter Island
- Choker
- 2100 S

### Other Existing Conditions Analyzed:
- Intersection Control
- Marked Pedestrian Crossings
- Reported Crashes Involving People Walking
- Reported Crashes Involving People Bicycling
- All Crashes
- Existing Traffic Calming

## Existing Conditions Summary

An evaluation of the study area revealed:
- Regardless of collection period, Hollywood Ave sees the highest vehicle volumes of the east-west streets
- North-south streets see higher vehicle speeds, though 85th percentile speeds throughout the study are not exceptionally high
- Injury crashes are largely limited to the perimeter of the study area

## Community Feedback

### Community Meeting
A community meeting was held on July 26th, 2022. Initiated by community members, residents of the study area gathered to share their concerns about neighborhood traffic and collaborate on potential solutions. It was very apparent that traffic data collected did not always align with community sentiment and lived experience.

### What We Heard

**Address maintenance issues immediately:**
- Tree pruning to improve sight distance
- Refresh and update striping at key intersections and approaches
- Ensure consistent signage throughout the study area

**If necessary, prioritize traffic calming along Hollywood Avenue where majority of issues originate.**

**Define the neighborhood boundary and maintain community character.**

## Recommendations

### Address Maintenance Needs
To the greatest extent possible, remediate immediate maintenance needs, focusing on tree care, striping, and signage.

### Implement Area-Wide Traffic Calming in 2023
Given funding constraints, focus on lower-cost, effective traffic calming treatments. Distribute them throughout the study area.

### Vertical Devices
Speed lumps or speed humps are effective and easier to implement. They must be placed to avoid impacts on residential driveways, but there is adequate space in the study area at recommended locations.

### Hollywood Ave and 1000 East
The primary focus location for the community, apply near-term and longer-term options:
- Ensure adequate striping, including center lines, stop bars, and marked crossings
- Prune trees to guarantee adequate visibility of signs and pedestrian (sight distance)
- Install splitter islands on each approach to force drivers to slow down and navigate the traffic circle correctly
